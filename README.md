# fruit_image_classification
The repository contains 4 Jupyter notebooks for the 4 experiments performed. All experimentsare performed using the Fruits 360 dataset which is available at https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset.

The following are the 4 Jupyter notebooks and a brief description of their contents:

1. #### fruit_images_classification_using data augmentation4.ipynb:
This notebook contains the first experiment where a self-designed 14-layer convolutional neural net is used for fruit image classification. 

2. #### fruit_images_classification_using_inception v3.ipynb:
This notebook contains the second experiment where a CNN based on transfer learning using Inception-v3 model is exploited for fruit image classification. 

3. #### fruit_image_classification_using vgg16_transfer learning_data augmentation4.ipynb
This notebook contains the third experiment where a CNN based on transfer learning using VGG16 model is exploited for fruit image classification. 

4. #### fruit_image_classification_using vgg16_fine tuning_data augmentation_RMSprop3.ipynb
This notebook contains the fourth experiment where a CNN based on fine tuning using VGG16 model is exploited for fruit image classification.
